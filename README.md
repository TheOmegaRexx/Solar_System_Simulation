# Solar System Simulation

A simple Python simulation of the solar system using the Pygame library. This project visualizes the orbits of various planets around the Sun, taking into account gravitational forces.

## Features

- Planets are represented as objects with their own properties such as mass, initial position, and velocity.
- Gravitational forces are calculated between planets, affecting their motion and orbits.
- The simulation utilizes Pygame for easy visualization and interaction.

## Planets Included

- **Sun:** Yellow star at the center.
- **Earth:** Blue planet with an orbit around the Sun.
- **Mars:** Red planet with its own orbit.
- **Mercury:** Gray planet with a unique orbit.
- **Venus:** White planet with its orbit around the Sun.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the `solar_system.py` file.

## Controls

- Close the simulation window to exit.
